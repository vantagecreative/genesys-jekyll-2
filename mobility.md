                    <p>Payments are an integral part of any marketplace. When service providers are paid timely, have robust reporting, and access to manage their own payment accounts, they come back to the platform to provide great customer experiences. Payments platform are also very complex. They are vulnerable to fraud, hackers, and other bad actors.
