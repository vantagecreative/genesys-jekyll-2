<p>Genesys Impact was tasked by DC Prep to design and build the schoolâ€™s telecommunications system, to included structured cabling, CAT6 cabling and fiber cabling for voice and data. Our technicians installed over 75,000 feet of CAT6 cable and 1,500 feet of fiber cable to connect the IDF and MDF of the two-building school.</p>
<p>This project called for the relocation of the MDF to a new location. Genesys Impact built the telecommunication rooms (MDF and IDF) and installed racks, patch panels, cable (vertical and horizontal), fiber wirings and connectors.</p>
<p>All cabling and data and voice jacks were tested for compliance with TIA/EIA/NAFPA/NEC standards for communications cabling using appropriate BICSI methods.</p>
