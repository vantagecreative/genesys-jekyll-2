<p>Updating our schoolâ€™s IT Infrastructure and Security to help keep schools safe is a top priority at Genesys Impact. At the historic Jesse Reno Rose School, our team was tasked with supplying equipment, materials and labor for installing and configuring telecommunications and security systems.</p>

<p>Over 60,000 feet of CAT6 cables, 18/4 cables, cable tray pathways, conduits, sleeves and power systems were installed throughout the building. Genesys Impact furnished and installed the fiber optic vertical cabling between TRs (MDF and IDFs) and a complete cable channel assembly to include: horizontal cable, patch panel port, faceplates and jacks.</p>

<p>Additionally, installation consisted of an access control system, CCTV surveillance system, and an intrusion detection alarm system.</p>
