<p>Modernizing our schoolâ€™s IT Infrastructure is critical for keeping up with 21st Century educational demands. At the Latin American Montessori School, Genesys Impact designed and developed RCDD stamped telecommunications drawings for the cabling plant based on the site survey performed by our engineers. The design included all telecommunications cabling plants (horizontal and backbone, LAN/TRs, demarcation rooms, fiber optic and copper cabling and pathways) and the layout of the security surveillance cameras, access control system and intrusion detection devices.</p>
<p>The implementation included telecommunication structured cabling system, audio-visual security access control system, video intercom, burglar alarm system and technical user training for the school IT department. Tasks consisted of the installation and configuration of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>20,000 feet of CAT6e and 2 server racks</li>
    <li>Complete Extron/Shure AV solution for the multipurpose room</li>
    <li>CCTV 14 Vivotek/Exacq NVR-based IP security cameras to be accessed remotely and by phone</li>
    <li>15 Smart Boards with AV system</li>
    <li>Full telephone IP-based NEC solution (40 NEC phones and 5 Polycom)</li>
</ul>
<p>Work on the 30,000 square foot school building consisting of 15 classrooms was completed in less than 30 days.</p>
