<p>Genesys Impact has a long, successful history of providing IT and Security Infrastructure for educational institutions.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> At Achievement Prep Academy, Genesys Impact designed and implemented the voice and data network infrastructure along with access control, burglar alarm and CCTV security systems.</p>
<p>The cabling infrastructure comprised of over 50,000 feet of Hubbell CAT6 S/UTP cable, 8,000 feet of RG-6U Hubbell coax cable, 5,000 feet of Belden 12-strand multimode OM4 fiber optic cable, 1,000 feet of Belden 25-pair cable, and 10,000 feet of shielded 18/4 cables. To ensure proper functioning of the systems, we furnished Hubbell faceplates, inserts for faceplates, blank inserts, and fiber optic connector assemblies.</p>
<p>In addition, our team installed a full Shure/Crestron AV system and 30 Epson interactive projectors. In the classrooms and offices, a full NEC VOIP system was configured and installed with 130 phones.</p>
<p>The security systems installed comprised a fully integrated CCTV system (Vivotek and Exacq) with a Honeywell and HID access control alarm system.</span></p>
<p>The timely delivery and completion of this projected allowed the school administration and students to move in as scheduled.</span></p>
