                    <p>Who’s keeping track of your employees, operations, and assets when you’re not around?</p>
                    <p>Automated Time Tracking will ensure that your properties are safe and secure whether you’re down the street or across the country.</p>
                    <p>We specifically recommend ATT for businesses that require high-security or come with potential safety hazards. This technology can ensure unauthorized persons do not have access to certain rooms or even levels of your building. ATT can also track the exact location of your employees to provide security and safety in case of emergency.</p>
                    <p>Genesys Impact has created our own Time Management tool, Crowdkeep, to provide you and your business with an all-in-one service with the following features:</p>

                    <p>The bigger your business, the easier it can be to lose track of shipments or inventory — we’re here to ensure that never happens.</p>
                    <p>Our asset management options are cost-effective, high-tech, and will ensure your projects are organized and on track. Our tracking system will also ensure you’re always on top of your inventory and business plan.</p>
                    <p>We offer two types of trackers:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fixed Trackers: Perfect for large warehouses full of products. These trackers will map your items and keep your inventory organized.</li>
                        <li>Mobile Trackers: These trackers can be placed on the actual assets and can help you to identify the product before opening the shipment at your location.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Both trackers are modeled on BLE Beacons, which are weather-resistant, water-repellent, and have a four-year battery life.</p>
                    <p>We’ll work with you to figure out which type of tracker is best for your business. We’ll then provide you with a strategy to ensure you’re taking full advantage of the system, and we’ll always be available for any support or maintenance down the road. </p>
