<span style="font-weight: 400;">Where does your customer spend their time? Whether you’re targeting teens or soccer moms, it’s safe to say there’s a very good change your target market spends lots of time online. So, how can you play this to you and your business’s advantage?</span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">First and foremost, does your business have a mobile-friendly website? If not, consider creating one ASAP. At the bare minimum, at least create social media pages as a stand-in website. There are</span> [<span style="font-weight: 400;">plenty of companies</span>](http://digitalrevamp.com/) <span style="font-weight: 400;">in the Washington D.C. area who can do this for you for a reasonable rate. Websites are key to business growth because they increase your discoverability and credibility. If your company does have a website, you are off to a great start.</span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are five more tech tools to keep your business thriving in the digital landscape of 2018. If you’re looking for a more personalized assessment for your business, our team at Genesys Impact can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">set up a meeting[add internal link]</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to consult your business on how to stay competitive in today’s digital age.</span>
</p>
<h3>1. SEO</h3>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Does your company have an amazing product and/or service that could truly change the market and leave your competitors in the dust?</span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you getting the website traffic you’d like?</span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If not, you should try investing in SEO (Search Engine Optimization) tools, such as SEMRush, Google Analytics, or Yoast. These tools allow your business to find out what relevant words and phrases are being searched for by your target market.</span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With this information, you are able to incorporate these keywords into your website and lock in those potential customers. It’s time to work smarter, not harder, and with SEO tools your business’s website could jump to the top of the Google rankings and increase the number of visits to your site — converting traffic into sales.</span>
</p>
<h3>2. A Strong Cyber Security Plan</h3>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You wouldn’t leave your house with the door unlocked, so why would you leave your digital assets and data without the proper security?</span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Every 39 seconds, there is a hacker attack. Many small businesses are targets of these attacks because they don’t implement the security they need. Don’t be another statistic.</span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here at Genesys Impact, we specialize in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">physical security[add internal link]</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">(eg: CCTV and security cameras) and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cyber security[add internal link]</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">so that your business can stay safe from attacks.</span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Too many businesses leave security as an afterthought until it’s too late, even big-time corporations like Target have fallen victim to</span> [<span style="font-weight: 400;">business-altering attacks</span>](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-target-breach-idUSBRE9BH1GX20131219)<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Make the smart investment and get the proper security plan in place before it’s too late. You’ll be glad you did!</span>
</p>
<h3>3. AdRoll</h3>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, back to SEO. If you want to expand on SEO tools and really increase your company’s presence, consider</span> [<span style="font-weight: 400;">AdRoll</span>](https://www.adroll.com/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">. AdRoll works by taking data from the cookies on your site and then displaying relevant ads to potential customers surfing the web. AdRoll has a huge ad exchange network, meaning that once you purchase its services and run your digital ad(s), your ads will be seen on top-tier sites, like social media networks and news platforms. Pricing for this advertising tool starts at about about $100 a month.</span>
</p>
<h3>4. Online Project Management</h3>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once your company starts receiving the desired amount of website traffic and you have an influx of clients to serve, you’ll need a tool to effectively manage your projects.</span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Investing in online project management software allows you and your staff to better manage the complex and collaborative projects of your business. Tools such as</span> [<span style="font-weight: 400;">Trello</span>](https://trello.com/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span> [<span style="font-weight: 400;">Asana</span>](https://asana.com/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">, and</span> [<span style="font-weight: 400;">Basecamp</span>](https://basecamp.com/) <span style="font-weight: 400;">offer your team an online collaboration space and allows managers to organize and allocate tasks as well as resources.</span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The software streamlines communication, document sharing, scheduling, issue tracking and status updates. Online project management tools enable your company to perform its daily functions with the utmost efficiency, and it makes it easy for you as a manager to keep track of projects to ensure everything is getting done.</span>
</p>
<h3>5. Cloud-Based Solutions</h3>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that your company has a solid clientele, it’s time to invest in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud-based business solutions [add internal link]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud storage</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is a term that refers to the online space that your businesses can use to store its data. Instead of keeping your files backed up on physical </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">storage</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">devices such as a USB, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud storage</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">provides a secure way to remotely store your company’s important data. Using Cloud storage eliminates the costs of buying and maintaining your own storage infrastructure. It also ensures that your employees can work from anywhere, and that data will never be lost.</span>
<br><br>
While there’s no “one size fits all” approach, every one of these tools can boost every kind of business — whether you’re a non-profit organization or a hair salon. The key is to use these tools together with a thoroughly trained staff that understands the ins and outs of our digital culture. Here at Genesys Impact, we aim to provide you with all the tools your business needs to thrive.
