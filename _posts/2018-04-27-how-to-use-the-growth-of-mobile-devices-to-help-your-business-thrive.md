Did you know that 95% of Americans own a mobile device? In the Washington D.C. area, we’re willing to bet that percentage is even larger. As mobile phone usage continues to spread like wildfire, it’s no wonder so many companies are utilizing mobile tech to grow their businesses. In fact, with such prolific technology at their disposal, one might ask—why _wouldn’t _companies use mobile technology to their advantage? The answer to this question — for many companies — is that they simply don&#8217;t know where to start. If your business falls under that category, don’t worry! We’ve got you covered.

We understand how the world of mobile tech can appear overwhelming, so we’re breaking it down for you. Below, we explain six reliable ways that you can use mobile technology to grow your business — whether you’re a government agency, a nonprofit, or even a fashion boutique.
</p>
<h3>1. Create a Mobile App</h3>
<p>
  If you are looking to employ mobile technology, creating an app is great place to start. A mobile app can help your business grow its income, consumer data, and customer service. Below, we address each of these mobile-app benefits in detail:
</p>
<h4>
  Increased Revenue
</h4>

<p>
  To start, mobile apps can generate more income by creating another avenue for customers to do the things that make you money (i.e buying products, making reservations) wherever and whenever they want. Furthermore, you can make money off app usage itself, either through in-app advertisements, or by offering “premium” upgrades.
</p>

<h4>
  Improved Consumer Data
</h4>

<p>
  A mobile app can also double as a source for consumer statistics. Being knowledgeable about your customers is vital if you want to grow your business. With a mobile app, you already have all this important information at your disposal. All you need is the right analysis [add internal link] — done by a knowledgeable IT company like Genesys Impact —  to make sense of your data and put it to use!
</p>

<h4>
  Improved Customer Service
</h4>

<p>
  An app allows for instant, improved communication with customers. By creating an in-app “chat” service, you open up another channel through which consumers can engage with company representatives. This can be especially beneficial for customers who do not have the time to come chat in person or wait on hold over the phone. Expanding customer communication in this new, modern way can ultimately improve customer service and satisfaction.
</p>

<h3>2. Convert Website Content into a Mobile-Friendly Format</h3>
<p>
  In addition to creating an app, business’ can also benefit from offering a mobile-view format of their website. A mobile-friendly viewing option ensures that customers who choose not to download your app can still browse your website with ease from their phones.
    <br><br>
  Just like a mobile app, offering a mobile-view website format can increase website accessibility, traffic, and ultimately revenue. In fact, depending on your target market, not having a mobile-friendly site can actually deter customers, so be careful!
</p>
<h3>3. Accept Payments</h3>
<p>
  Today, there are many mobile apps (eg:[Square](https://squareup.com/)) that allow business’ to take payments using a mobile phone or tablet. Not only can this cut down on the cost of buying registers, it also serves as a back up plan to speed things up when the register(s) get backed up. Because these apps typically email customers receipts, they also cut down paper usage — saving you money and allowing your business to be more eco-friendly.
</p>
<h3>4. Social Media Marketing</h3>
<p>
  While social media accounts can be somewhat managed through desktops, cell phones allow company representatives to update profiles on the go. The benefits of this mobile access are endless. Your business can record live videos of events through Snapchat, make last minute announcements on Twitter, and update Instagram with photos showcasing your products and services.
    <br><br>
  Social media users never unplug, so to get the most out of social media marketing, companies should use stay plugged-in on the go too!
</p>
<h3>5. Cloud Apps</h3>
<p>
  We’ve talked a lot about how mobile tech can improve external business goals, but mobile tech can help your business improve internal relations as well. Moving your business to the cloud [add internal link] is one simple tech move that your company can do to grow internally.
  <br><br>
  Cloud softwares allow companies to securely store information, and allow employees to access the information from any device with internet access. By allowing employees to access information from anywhere and anytime, cloud software makes it easier for employees to work from anywhere at anytime.
  <br><br>
  When used correctly, cloud apps can increase internal resource accessibility, communication, organization, and productivity.
</p>
