<span style="font-weight: 400;">Is your building as secure as it could be? Here at Genesys Impact, we want to make sure you’re not making any of these security mistakes.</span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here in Washington D.C., we’re surrounded by secure and safeguarded compounds such as the</span> [<span style="font-weight: 400;">CIA</span>](https://www.cia.gov/index.html) <span style="font-weight: 400;">in Virginia, the White House in D.C., and countless other government buildings that the average Joe (or Jane) will never be able to waltz right into.</span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">While your business may not require the security levels of the White House, it’s important that your offices, employees, data, and other assets are secure.</span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s where Genesys Impact comes in, we’re here to assess, suggest, and then install any </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">security safeguards [add internal link]</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">your business may need — whether it’s CCTV or ICam enabled technology.</span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But before we get into all that, here are the building security mistakes you might be making.</span>
</p>
<h3>1. Using a “One-Size Fits All” Approach</h3>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like your business needs a customized approach, so does your building security.</span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most common mistakes people make with building security is blanketing one security system on a building without taking specific rooms, personnel, or assets into consideration.</span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here at Genesys Impact, we’ll work with you to ensure that your building has the best security that caters to its needs — because it doesn’t make sense to have the same security on your employee break room as you have on your computer server room.</span>
</p>
<h3>2. Forgetting About Emergency Exits</h3>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you think security, you think the main entrance that your employees walk through every day — but what about the less commonly used entrances and exits?</span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When securing their buildings, many people forget about the rarely used emergency exits. If you have ground floor windows, you may also want to install security monitors on those.</span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Having all your bases covered is one of the most important aspects of a good security system — don’t skip over any entry points!</span>
</p>
<h3>3. Not Training Security Personnel Properly</h3>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re going to invest in a high-tech security system, you also need to invest in proper training for your employees.</span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Too many great security systems are underutilized by personnel that don’t understand all of its functions.</span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of the day, your security system is only as good as the employee overseeing it. Take the time to ensure your security personnel knows all the ins and outs of your security system of choice.</span>
</p>
<h3>4. Putting Aesthetics Over Safety</h3>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s easy to think that your front office is too pretty to have a security camera stationed at the entrance. But office building security is more important than appearance, and many new technologies are small and easy to blend with your building’s current decor.</span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Other business owners worry that their customers may feel uneasy if they see security cameras in plain site, when in fact the opposite is true. After all, if anything were to happen to those customers, it should comfort them that your CCTV system will catch it all on camera.</span>
</p>
<h3>5. DIY-ing It</h3>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We know it’s all about cutting costs, especially if your business is still in its startup stages, but some things should be left to the professionals.</span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, DIY-ing it could end up costing you more money solely because you may not know where to install cameras for maximum security, and therefore end up thinking you need more cameras than you really do.</span>
<br><br> 
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let our professionals at Genesys Impact — who have worked with plenty of companies in the Washington D.C. and DMV areas — install your security so that you don’t make any of these mistakes!</span>
