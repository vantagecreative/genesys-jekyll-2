                    <p>Not only does DevOps reduce the time needed to address customer reviews, but DevOps also centralizes business processes while saving you money. It cuts the time it takes to get from idea to production in half, maximizing business uptime and revenue.</p>
                    <p>Development & Operations, otherwise known as DevOps, is an approach to crisp software delivery that paves the way for closer collaboration between lines of business and IT operations. In the past, development and operations have been separate functions, but now DevOps combines these operations, therefore minimizing the precious time needed to manage customer feedback.</p>
                    <p>The modern-day DevOps techniques we offer at Genesys Impact includes LaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. To make this transition easier for your business, we are happy to work with the infrastructure of your choice, including but not limited to public clouds (Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud), hybrid environments, on-premises, and private clouds.</p>

                    <p>We know how difficult it can be to sort through copious amounts of data when searching for the answers you need. We use specialized analytics to connect the dots between your information to reveal conclusions or stories that otherwise would have gone unnoticed.</p>
                    <p>Discover consumer trends hidden in seemingly scattered points of data or obtain crucial information about worker productivity. Big Data can help you run your business in every aspect and provide you with the information to be successful — whether that means making decisions today or planning decisions for five years down the road.</p>
                    <h3>How Can Big Data Analytics help your organization?</h3>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Data Mining:</strong> With the right data mining software, you can pick out patterns from what looks like an overwhelming amount of data. This information can help your business make more informed decisions and assess complex situations. </li>
                            <li><strong>Data Management:</strong> For every organization, data is constantly moving in and out. You need a system that will continually organize your data to make it reliable for your use, so that when you need it, it’s ready for you and easy to navigate.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hadoop:</strong> To perform big data analytics, you need a programming framework that can process various volumes of data. Hadoop technology provides you with these features and provides the added benefit of open source framework for free.</li>
                            <li><strong>In-memory analytics:</strong> Increase your company’s dexterity by gaining the ability to analyze your data from system memory. This allows you to quickly determine insights on the latest sets of data and empowers you to make more informed decisions.</li>

                            <li><strong>Text mining:</strong> Our text mining technology allows you to take text data and analyze it to reveal information about your organization’s performance. Text mining can scan any place on your website or platform to highlight patterns or trends. You can scan comment sections, books, emails, or other text-based sources on either your in-house network or public documents such as blogs to gain both internal insight as well as competitive intelligence.</li>
                            <li><strong>Mongo DB:</strong> Mongo Databases are flexible to meet the needs of your projects and steady with the rise of new technology to give you a competitive edge so that no data gets left behind or delayed.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cassandra:</strong> This system offers you the highest performance in data recovery and storage and are made to handle copious amounts of data by storing them across several data centers, so your data will never be slow to load or crash.</li>

                <dd>
                    <p>To stay competitive, your business must modernize and embrace new software standards. With an Application Program Interface (API), data streams between systems and applications are consolidated, simplifying your IT infrastructure. An API also allows companies and CIOs (or whoever handles information systems at your company) to make alterations to their IT infrastructure without disturbing its current state. In other words, there will be no “down time” while re-structuring your system, so your business can continue running as normal. With an API, your software will be secure, up-to-date, and continually competitive.</p>
                    <p>Genesys Impact offers the following API and System Integration services:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>API Development</li>
                            <li>API Management</li>
                            <li>Enhancing Existing APIs</li>
                            <li>API Security</li>
                        </ul>
